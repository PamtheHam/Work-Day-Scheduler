# Work-Day-Scheduler
In this project, I modified starter code on a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the standard work day. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery and Bootstrap. When the user interacts with the page, they can input text into a timeblock which will save the input and hour of the timeblock in local storage. Each timeblock is color coded so that past hours are grey, present hours are red, and future hours are green.
